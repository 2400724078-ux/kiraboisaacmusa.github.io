    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Our mission is to promote awareness and understanding of Uganda’s aquatic ecosystems, 
      highlighting the importance of biodiversity and sustainability. 
      We believe that education can inspire conservation and action.</p>

    <h2>Economic Importance</h2>
    <p>Marine life in Uganda plays a vital role in the economy, supporting fisheries, tourism, and trade. 
      The Nile Perch industry alone provides livelihoods to thousands across the Lake Victoria basin.</p>

    <h2>Team & Collaboration</h2>
    <p>This project was created by a team of students passionate about environmental education. We collaborate with local communities, environmentalists, and researchers to document and share Uganda’s unique aquatic heritage.
      credit mostly goes to my team mates who helped with providing information needed to build this project.
